						<h2>Midterm and Final Projects</h2>
						<br>
						<h3>Description:</h3>
						<p>
							This is by far the largest component of the course.
							You will discover, explore, and attack a real world
							problem of your choosing.
							There are <b> three </b> types of projects you
							can work on, shown below in order of increasing difficulty:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								(1) Application of existing algorithm based on differential
								geometry to a new problem and
								potentially new data.
							</li>
							<li>
								(2) Algorithmic work. Extend an existing differential geometry algorithm
	              or conceive a new one to solve some problem.
	              This inherently includes the first option because you will
	              need to test this new algorithm on data.
							</li>

							<li>
								(3) Theoretical work. Create a new learning algorithm based on
								differential geometric techniques.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Your final project can be an extension of your midterm project or
							you can start a new one.
	            At <i>any</i> time during the course <i>please</i> feel free
	            to come and discuss your problem and ask questions with the
	            instructor or TAs.
					</p>

					<h3>Requirements:</h3>
						All of the requirements below must be satisfied in order
						to receive full credits for the project:

					<ul>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Partner:</i></b> <br>
							No partner allowed. Every one should work by themselves.
						</li>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Dataset:</i></b> <br>
							You must use at least one dataset, which will be suitable
							for using differential geometry, as a significant part of
							your project.
						</li>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Format:</i></b> <br>
							Your submission must be submitted as a pdf in
							 <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/AuthorSubmissionInstructions">NIPS format</a>.
							 Note that this means you must use LaTeX with their
							 <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">style file</a>.
							 (NIPS, Neural Information Processing Systems,
							 is one of the major machine learning conferences).
						</li>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Code Style:</i></b> <br>
							All code used in the production of your final report should be clean
              <a href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">
								(suggested format)</a>
              and placed into a public GitHub repository. Place a footnote to the
              URL of this Github repository somewhere in your final pdf.
							This is not required but
              it is recommended to place your code under some
              <a href="http://choosealicense.com/">open-source license</a>
              such as <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT</a>.
						</li>
					</ul>


					<h3>Due Dates:</h3>

					<ul>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Jan 31: &nbsp;Midterm Project Proposal</i></b><br>
							Typed (LaTeX)
              one page maximum explaining your problem, what data
              sets you are likely to use (you must find some candidates),
              and what methods (of those you know of)
              you think you might use. Note that this is not 100% final
              but it should be within some epsilon of your midterm project.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Feb 28: &nbsp;Midterm Project Presentation</i></b><br>
							Maximum 8 minutes presentation detailing your progress towards
							your goal.
							You should specify the problem you work on,
							which algorithms you use, any research you have done to
							approach the problem and what you have found, any specific
							python libraries you use and , any
              necessary insight (mathematical or otherwise) you have
              conjured and proved, etc. You must show
							everything you have tried and
							be as detailed as possible.
						</li>
						<br>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>March 7: &nbsp; Midterm Project Submission</i></b> <br>
							Submission of the midterm project should be done electronically.
							It must include the Latex final report
							following NIPS format, all codes written for the project, the
							dataset, presentation (.pptx or .pdf) and any other files used.
							Must conform to the requirements above. If the dataset is too
							large to upload it to the Github, please contact instructor or
							TA for submission of the dataset.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>May 9: &nbsp;Final Project Draft Proposal</i></b><br>
							Typed (LaTeX)
							one page maximum explaining your problem, what data
							sets you are likely to use (you must find some candidates),
							and what methods (of those you know of)
							you think you might use. Note that this is not 100% final
							but it should be within some epsilon of your midterm project.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>May 19: &nbsp;Final Project Proposal</i></b><br>
							This final version of the final
							project proposal must be turned in before the class on May 19.

							Maximum 8 minutes presentation detailing your progress towards
							your goal.
							You should specify the problem you work on,
							which algorithms you use, any research you have done to
							approach the problem and what you have found, any specific
							python libraries you use and , any
              necessary insight (mathematical or otherwise) you have
