						<h3>Course Requirements and Evaluation:</h3>
						<p>
							&#9679; <b><i>Homework</i></b> <br>
							Homework will be assigned once a week and will be due every Monday
							before the lecture. Discussions and collaboration is encouraged.
							Solution hints also will be provided if necessary.  But you must
							write up your own solution. Before tackling any problems, read
							the relevant section of the text and review your lecture notes.
							Consult with the faculty, the tutor (Paul David) or your
							classmates about matters that are unclear to you.
							NEVER LET YOURSELF FALL BEHIND.
							<br><br>
							<i>Note:</i> <br>
							I am trying my best to help you succeed in this course.
							Trust me, I am on your side. However, you must try your best.
							This is a very advanced and challenge course. It will greatly
							benefit you for your future graduate study or industry work.
							Though it is very hard at the beginning since there are many
							very high level new concepts, you will finally get used to
							them. By the time you are in your graduate school or your
							work, you will certainly be at the top of the "mountain"
							as a student or an employee with your talent ought to be.
							So let us work really hard now!
							<br><br>

							&#9679; <b><i>Midterm/Final Projects</i></b> <br>

							The midterm and final projects are the largest components of the course.
							Each student will discover, explore, and attack a real world
							problem of your choosing. The detailed description and requirements
							for the midterm and final projects can be found under the
							"Mid/Final Project" tab.
							<br><br>

							&#9679; <b><i>GitHub</i></b> <br>

							Students are expected to
							become comfortable with Github. Hence, each student is required
							to create a Github account for midterm and
							final project submission. If you already have a Github account,
							that's perfect. If not, please create a personal Github account
							and go over the tutorials online.<br>
						</p>


						<h3>Classroom Policies:</h3>
						<p>
							&#9679; <b><i>Attendence</i></b> <br>

							Attendence for each lecture is mandatory and is expected of all
							class members. if you're going to miss a lecture, it is neccessary
							for you to inform the instructor as soon as possible. You are also
							responsible for obtaining notes from another class member.
							<br><br>


							&#9679; <b><i>Devices</i></b> <br>

							You are welcome to use your computer or tablet for note-taking
							(the PowerPoint slides will also be posted shortly after the
							lecture for your convenience).
						</p>

						<h3>Diabilities:</h3>
						<p>
							Students who need disability-related accommodations are
							encouraged to discuss this with the instructor as soon as
							possible.
